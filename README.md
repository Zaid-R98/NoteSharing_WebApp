## About this Project
This is a project which allows students to register and share class notes with their classmates once the notes have been approved by the instructor.

The application allows both students and the faculty to register themselves.

The faculty can view all notes from students they are teaching and have the ability to approve or disapprove notes.

The students, once registered can view approved notes from their classmates for a perticular course

The university admin can assign students to specific courses as well as assign faculty to those courses.
